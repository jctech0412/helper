    I can design/develop/test/deploy the smart contracts with solidity and truffle or hardhat. 
    I have much experience in Terra, and as you probably know the both Terra and Solana is written by Rust.
    So writing the smart contracts using the solana is my easy working.
    The last time, I've worked on similar projects and that's why I am willing to show you some of my projects via private chat.
    You can check my last project here:
