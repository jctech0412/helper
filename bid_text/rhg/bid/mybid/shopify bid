Dear. After reading my cover letter please contact me. I am Jay Hayasi a Developer with 6 years of experience in Shopify. 
I have worked as a Front-end developer, but I have a strong knowledge of e-commerce and third-party service integration. I have developed 6 projects based on Shopify. These projects are in Japan and Canada. One of them is in the ranking of shopping sites. About your description, I have rich experience in them. First, check these links.

I don't know size of your work. But as you mentioned in the post, I think it will be large and tight. Previously, I have worked hard, and I am comfortable with that. I can work for 40 hours per week. If you want when necessary, I can work on weekends.
You will make a decision seriously but I am confident about my abilities.
I hope you will get success in your project.
Thx
