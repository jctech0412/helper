For 13 years I’ve spent programming (8 as primary income) I’ve been cultivating persistence, performance, and a love for challenges, which allows me to consistently deliver complex tasks that others might give up.
Of course, programming is always a learning experience and I am to this day doing that.

Now, I have been freelancing for the past 5 years. When it comes to my core fundamentals Blockchain, Mining, developing wallets, exchanges both DEX and CEX, NFT marketplace places and Smart Contract are on the top. 
Also, I have worked with AWS for 3 years which arms me with excessive dev-ops and server-side security experience. 
Along with that, I have developed and launched 140+ mobile and web-applications with active userbase to this day.

Tech Stack that I have worked with:
* Node.Js, Php, Laravel, React, React.js, Electron.Js
* Solidity, Rust. * ERC20, ERC721, Defi Apps, DEX
* Python, Django, Django REST framework, Flask
* PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB
* Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD configuration
* Automation and Scraping: Scrapy, Selenium, requests, BeautifulSoup, etc * Core web: XML, JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* WordPress, Shopify, WIX
* Google Cloud, AWS, Azure
* Git, GitLab, Bitbucket, Heroku
Chains that I have fully Grasped:
Bitcoin | Ethereum | Solana | XRPL | Stellar | Hyperledger and | Corda {​​​and safe to say I can work on almost all the chains}
With AI/ML, I have worked with several algorithms Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest Algorithm, and Linear Regression. 
On top of that, I have been following OpenAI closely and looking to actively start working on my own AI projects.

While I won't say I am the best or I can do everything, what I can assure you is that I can be the WIZARD that can resolve all of your issues after doing RND and I am up for hour-long discussions to make sure I understand your requirements perfectly.

I have all hands on deck at this point! So let's discuss this further.
