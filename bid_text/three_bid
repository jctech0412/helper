Hello,  I am a 3D artist and developer with React/WebGL/Three.js/GSAP/Pixi.js for over 5 years.
Jobs have included 3d model viewers, product configurators, bone-based animation, first person 
training simulations, particle effects, procedural mesh generation, multi-layer 2D sprite 
environments, and motion capture/motion tracking for armature animation.

??????????????

To expound upon the v.r. experience: While working on staff at the lab I was tasked with 
developing software for an accelerometer-based glove apparatus, learned about VR theory and 
methods of application, worked with a unity-like engine, and modeled in 3DStudioMax and Blender. 
I was also involved in the various upkeep and troubleshooting needs of a VR-capable network of 
nodes and projectors.

Looking forward to working with you. Thanks!
